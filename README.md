# Book Recommender 

This  <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/murtagh97/book_recommender/main/st_app_recommender.py" target="_blank">web app </a> offers a book recommendation engine built with the use of the <a href="http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/" target="_blank">Book-Crossing Dataset</a>.

Individual app sections allow user to: 
* Select a book and create top 5 recommendations,
* See data visualisation with an exploratory data analysis of the dataset in question.

All the data manipulation and modelling process can be found in the colab notebook.
